# Ackerman_Gazebo_Simulink
From SolidWorks import URDF models then launch it in gazebo ,to prepare for further simulition.

copy the file ackerman to your workspace then you can test it by rviz through:

roslaunch ackerman display.launch 

or test it in gazebo through:

roslaunch ackerman gazebo.launch 

Please move to Bilibili to watch my steps：

Please Help Me：

I need to simulate an Ackerman car in ROS to test the algorithm in the future. Here I apply for a project. I hope you can give me some advice

Up to now, we have encountered the problem of die piercing in gazebo, which can be simulated normally in SolidWorks, but can not be used normally in gazebo

The video of station B above is displayed, thank you!

请帮助我：

本人最近需要在ROS中模拟一个阿克曼车型的小车用来日后测试算法，这里申请一个项目，希望有兴趣的朋友能指点一二
截至目前，遇到了Gazebo中的穿模问题，在SolidWorks中能够正常仿真，但是放到Gazebo中无法正常使用，该问题已经在
上述的B站视频中展示，感谢！
